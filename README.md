## What is a DAO

DAO stands for **D**ecentalized **A**utonomous **O**rganisation. That is a group of people with shared goals/mission that are governed by an agreed set of rules coded into a smart contract(s) on a blockchain.

If you want to learn more about DAOs, check out Cooper Turley's blog at https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/essays, mainly ["The Rise of Micro-Economies"](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI).

## What is NhkDAO

The project was started by Belazy and JayP as an experiment to test our Solidity and React Skills

## How do I join?

The DAO operates inside our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ASjBPJuNhS). To gain access to this server you need to own a [NHK]() NFT. The contract for purchasing one [can be found on etherscan.io](). If you're not sure how to mint an NFT, [check out this how-to article](https://jonkuperman.com/how-to-join-developer-dao/) by @jkup.

Whilst there is basic charge for the NFT which you will have to pay with nhk tokens (we will burn the same amount of token used to buy for nft) in order to mint one. 

That said, there is a limited supply of NFT's that can be created so don't wait too long!

To find available tokenIDs you can mint try this tool created by the community - https://ddao.ibby.dev/.

If you get stuck please reach out on our [Discord] and we'd be happy to help.

## What is this repo?

This is the code for the [public NHK DAO site](https://developerdao.com/).

At the moment it allows members to view their genesis NFT by entering in its ID. As the community takes shape we will decide what this website becomes and build it as a collective.
